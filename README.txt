Introduction
============

The ``gs.group.member.list`` product provides some simple lists of 
group members.

============
Members Page
============

Linked to from the group homepage, the Members page lists the members
of the group. It is a simple list: only the profile photo, name, and
membership status is listed.

The Members Directory (found in ``gs.group.member.directory``) provides
a more complete and complex page, that allows members to be sorted based
on different fields.
