  <div id="gs-group-members-list-all">
    <h3>Viewing All the Members</h3>
    <p>
      You can view all members of a group if
      <!--TODO: Link to the right place-->
      The group is <strong>private</strong>, or 
      <strong>secret</strong>, and you are a member of the group.
      To view the list of all group members carry out the following.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit the Members page for the group.</li>
      <li>Click on the <samp class="tab">All Members</samp> tab.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The list if members will be shown, broken down into three 
      sections.
      In the first section the group administrators are listed.
      These people administer the group and its members.
      Next all the normal members are listed.
      All the normal members (and the administrators) can view any post
      you make to the group.
      Finally, the people who the administrators have invited to join
      the group are listed.
      These people will be able to view your posts in the future.
